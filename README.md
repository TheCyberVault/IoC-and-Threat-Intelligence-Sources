# Understanding Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds


Numerous sources, including open-source community groups, commercial entities, and government organizations, offer Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and threat intelligence feeds. These feeds can supply actionable intelligence that helps in defending against upcoming threats or in identifying signs of past intrusions, a process known as threat hunting.

However, accessing most of these informational resources typically involves a registration process or a paid subscription. This precaution is taken because attackers could potentially use this information to evade detection. As a result, providers and vendors aim to restrict access to this sensitive data, ensuring it's only available to legitimate, non-malicious users. Consequently, demonstrating these services in a lab setting is not feasible.
